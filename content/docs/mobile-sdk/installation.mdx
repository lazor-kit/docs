# Installation

Install the adapter and its dependencies using your preferred package manager.

```bash
npm install @lazorkit/wallet-mobile-adapter
```

## Peer Dependencies

The SDK relies on several peer dependencies that you must install in your project to ensure compatibility, especially with Expo and React Native.

```bash
npm install @coral-xyz/anchor \
            @react-native-async-storage/async-storage \
            buffer \
            expo-web-browser \
            js-sha256 \
            react-native-get-random-values \
            zustand
```

## Polyfills Setup

Since React Native does not support all Node.js APIs out of the box, you need to configure polyfills.

1.  **Install `react-native-get-random-values`**: This is required for cryptographic operations.
2.  **Import Polyfills**: Add the following imports at the very top of your application's entry file (e.g., `App.tsx` or `index.js`), **before** any other imports.

```typescript
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import { Buffer } from 'buffer';

// Polyfill Buffer globally
global.Buffer = Buffer;
```

## Expo Configuration

If you are using Expo, ensure you have configured your `app.json` or `app.config.js` to support deep linking, as the authentication flow relies on redirect URLs.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "your-app-scheme"
  }
}
```
