# Smart Wallet Actions

Smart wallets allow for advanced functionality like transaction bundling, policy checks, and fee sponsorship.

## Executing a Transaction

To execute a Solana transaction through the smart wallet:

```typescript
import { SmartWalletAction } from '@lazorkit/wallet-mobile-adapter';

const action = {
  type: SmartWalletAction.Execute,
  args: {
    policyInstruction: null, // Optional policy check
    cpiInstruction: myTransferInstruction // The actual instruction to execute
  }
};

const txSignature = await signMessage(action, {
  redirectUrl: 'your-app://callback'
});
```

## Creating a Chunk (Deferred Execution)

Chunks allow you to sign a transaction now but execute it later, or execute it in multiple parts.

```typescript
const action = {
  type: SmartWalletAction.CreateChunk,
  args: {
    cpiInstructions: [ix1, ix2, ix3], // Multiple instructions
    policyInstruction: null
  }
};

await signMessage(action, { ... });
```
