# Wallet Search

One of the challenges with smart wallets is knowing the address. LazorKit provides methods to find a wallet based on the user's authentication credentials.

## By Passkey Public Key

If you have the user's Passkey public key, you can find their wallet:

```typescript
import { LazorkitClient } from '@lazorkit/wallet-mobile-adapter';

const client = new LazorkitClient(connection);
const result = await client.getSmartWalletByPasskey(passkeyBytes);

if (result.smartWallet) {
  console.log('Found wallet:', result.smartWallet.toString());
}
```

## By Credential Hash

If you have the credential ID (hash), you can also search by that:

```typescript
const result = await client.getSmartWalletByCredentialHash(credentialHashBytes);
```

## Combined Search

Use `findSmartWallet` to try both methods:

```typescript
const result = await client.findSmartWallet(passkeyBytes, credentialHashBytes);
```
