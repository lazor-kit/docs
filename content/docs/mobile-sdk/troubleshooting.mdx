# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### "Cannot resolve module"

Ensure you have installed all peer dependencies and configured polyfills correctly. See the [Installation](/docs/installation) guide.

### WebAuthn Not Working

- **HTTPS**: WebAuthn requires a secure context (HTTPS) or localhost.
- **Redirect URL**: Ensure your `redirectUrl` matches exactly what is configured in your app's scheme.

### Transaction Failed

- **Paymaster**: Check if the Paymaster URL is correct and the service is running.
- **Compute Units**: Complex transactions may require higher compute unit limits.

## Debugging

Enable debug mode in the provider to see detailed logs:

```tsx
<LazorKitProvider isDebug={true} ... />
```

This will log detailed information about connection attempts, signing flows, and errors to the console.
