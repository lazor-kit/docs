# Troubleshooting

## General Debugging

Enable debug mode in your `LazorKitProvider` (or `LazorkitProvider` for React) to see detailed logs about connection attempts, signing flows, and errors.

```tsx
<LazorKitProvider isDebug={true} ... />
```

This will log detailed information to the console.

## Common Issues

### Transaction Failed

- **Paymaster Config**: Verify your `paymasterUrl` and `apiKey` are correct.
- **Compute Units**: Complex transactions may require higher compute unit limits. Try increasing `computeUnitLimit` in `transactionOptions`.
- **Insufficient Funds**: Even with a paymaster, some operations might require the smart wallet to have a minimum balance if not fully sponsored.

### "Wallet not connected" Error

Ensure you are wrapping your application with the Provider component and that the component calling `useWallet` is a child of the provider.

## React Native Specific

### "Cannot resolve module"

Ensure you have installed all peer dependencies and configured polyfills correctly. See the [Installation](/docs/react-native-sdk/installation) guide.

### WebAuthn / Deep Linking Issues

- **HTTPS**: WebAuthn requires a secure context (HTTPS) or localhost (for development).
- **Redirect URL**: Ensure your `redirectUrl` matches exactly what is configured in your app's scheme (Info.plist / app.json).
- **Deep Linking Logs**: Check native logs (`npx expo start`) for any reported linking errors if the app doesn't open.

## React SDK Specific

### Dialog Does Not Open

1. **Browser Blocking**: Some browsers block popups. Ensure the portal popup is allowed.
2. **Network**: Verify connectivity to the LazorKit portal.
