# Lazor.Kit Protocol

Lazor.Kit is a **developer-friendly protocol** that provides **secure, fast, and seamless authentication** and transaction execution on Solana. It eliminates the complexity of private keys and unreliable wallet integrations by introducing **passkey authentication** and **gasless transactions** via a relayer system.

## Why Lazor.Kit?

Lazor.Kit provides a **simple and robust solution** for DApps, ensuring:

- **üõ°Ô∏è Secured** ‚Äì Passkey-based authentication, no private keys required.
- **‚ö° Fast** ‚Äì Always accessible, even under high network traffic.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Easy** ‚Äì No deep link failures, seamless wallet integration.
- **üîó Simplest Sign-In with Solana** ‚Äì No wallet app needed, frictionless Web3 access.

## How It Works

1. **User authenticates via passkey** ‚Äì No need for traditional wallet apps.
2. **SDK generates and prepares the transaction** ‚Äì Handles wallet creation, transaction signing, and rule enforcement.
3. **Relayer submits and pays for the transaction** ‚Äì The user doesn't need to handle gas fees.
4. **Smart contracts execute the transaction on Solana** ‚Äì Ensuring a trustless and decentralized experience.

## Key Components

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Lazor.Kit SDK**
