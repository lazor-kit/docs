## Lazor.kit Protocol

Lazor.kit is a **developer-friendly protocol** that provides **secure, fast, and seamless authentication** and transaction execution on Solana. It eliminates the complexity of private keys and unreliable wallet integrations by introducing **passkey authentication** and **gasless transactions** via a relayer system.

## Why Lazor.kit?

Lazor.kit provides a **simple and robust solution** for DApps, ensuring:

- **🛡️ Secured** – Passkey-based authentication, no private keys required.
- **⚡ Fast** – Always accessible, even under high network traffic.
- **🛠️ Easy** – No deep link failures, seamless wallet integration.
- **🔗 Simplest Sign-In with Solana** – No wallet app needed, frictionless Web3 access.

## How It Works

1. **User authenticates via passkey** – No need for traditional wallet apps.
2. **SDK generates and prepares the transaction** – Handles wallet creation, transaction signing, and rule enforcement.
3. **Relayer submits and pays for the transaction** – The user doesn't need to handle gas fees.
4. **Smart contracts execute the transaction on Solana** – Ensuring a trustless and decentralized experience.

## What Can I Build?

Lazor.kit enables developers to build:
- **Seamless Web3 Applications** – Wallet creation & authentication without private key management.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platforms** – Gasless transactions for a frictionless user experience.
- **NFT & Gaming Applications** – Secure, rule-based smart wallets for asset management.
- **DAO & Governance Tools** – Automate voting and treasury actions with on-chain rules.
- **Any Solana-Based App** – That benefits from secure, fast, and permissionless interactions.

## Key Components

### **1️⃣ Lazor.kit SDK**  
- Provides **native passkey authentication** integration.  
- Handles **wallet creation, connection, and transaction signing**.  
- Offers **developer-friendly APIs** to interact with the protocol.  

### **2️⃣ Smart Contracts**  
- Manages **wallet creation & rule enforcement** on Solana.  
- Executes **transactions submitted by the relayer**.  

### **3️⃣ Transaction Relayer**  
- Covers **gas fees for all transactions**.  
- Ensures **transactions are submitted efficiently** on-chain.
