## The Smart Transaction Engine for Onchain Applications on Solana

Lazor.kit is a Solana-based framework designed to enable seamless, gasless, and user-friendly interactions for decentralized applications (DApps). By leveraging relayer technology and smart wallets, Lazor.kit simplifies blockchain interactions while ensuring security, decentralization, and composability.

## Why Lazor.kit?

Lazor.kit introduces a streamlined way to execute transactions on Solana without requiring users to manage gas fees or complex cryptographic operations. By integrating with the Lazor.kit SDK, developers can provide a frictionless experience where transactions are handled efficiently through a dedicated relayer system.

### **Key Features**

- **Gasless Transactions**: Users donâ€™t need to pay for gas; relayers cover transaction fees.
- **Smart Wallet Integration**: Supports programmable wallets with custom rules.
- **Passkey Authentication**: Users authenticate via passkeys, reducing reliance on private keys.
- **Seamless DApp Interactions**: Transactions can include wallet creation, rule updates, and smart contract executions.
- **Composability**: Fully integrates with existing Solana contracts and applications.

## What Can I Build with Lazor.kit?

Lazor.kit facilitates the development of next-generation onchain applications that prioritize decentralization, security, and usability. It is ideal for:

- **Consumer-friendly Web3 Applications**: Simplifies onboarding and interaction for mainstream users.
- **Permissionless Smart Wallets**: Enables user-defined transaction rules and security settings.
- **Autonomous Financial Applications**: Supports high-frequency DeFi transactions, marketplaces, and more.
- **Seamless Game Integrations**: Provides game developers with smart contract-based logic for in-game transactions.

## How It Works

1. **User Initiates an Action**: The client (user) interacts with the DApp using the Lazor.kit SDK.
2. **SDK Prepares a Transaction**: The SDK handles transaction logic, rule verification, and formatting.
3. **Relayer Signs and Pays Fees**: The transaction is forwarded to the relayer, which submits it on-chain.
4. **Smart Contracts Execute the Transaction**: The Lazor.kit contract processes the request securely and efficiently.

## Where Do I Start?

- **Developers**: Integrate the Lazor.kit SDK into your DApp to enable gasless transactions and smart wallet features.
- **Users**: Experience Web3 without the hassle of gas fees, private keys, or complex transactions.
